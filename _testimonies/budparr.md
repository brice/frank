title: Farewell Frank
---
I just ran across a commit by Frank in one of my old Jekyll repos. I still can't believe you're not with us. You were a true believer. Unwavering in your beliefs,  always there to help others, always straightforward and never seemed to want credit. You helped me more than you would know over the years and you will be sorely missed by me and our community that you had a hand in building.
