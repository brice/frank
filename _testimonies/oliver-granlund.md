title: Farewell from a stranger
---

I never expected the news to hit me as it did, making one random person on the internet feel saddened over another. We have only briefly exchanged messages on the Forestry CMS Slack, never got to meet nor even to know each other, yet I feel sad after receiving the news. Despite we only having a few moments with you, your energy and vibe is something that I admire and still think about. I wish we would have met. If the afterlife exists, let us share a toast when the time comes.

Sincerely, from one internet stranger to another.
